      "I am Nguyen Hung Thai, currently serving as the Head of Customer Service – a quiet companion in every moment the business touches the customer's heart.",
      "I began my career in Customer Service in 2002 – when call center agents still recorded tickets in Excel and \"customer service\" was simply... listen - record - respond.",
      "20 years later, I have worked in various environments – from telecommunications, e-commerce, insurance, finance, gaming, to technology – each place teaching me a new perspective on what truly makes a memorable experience.",
      "From Mobifone to Shopee, from Garena to Momo, Prudential, Finviet wallet, and now – I don't just take care of customers; I build systems so that everyone on the team can take care of customers better than I can.",
      "What makes me love this job is not just the thank-yous, but the lessons from dissatisfied customers.",
      "I always believe:\n👉 A good process is just the starting point.\n👉 A dedicated team is the real strength.\n👉 And technology – if applied at the right time, in the right place – can expand trust, not just automate.",
      "Therefore, I spend a lot of time building CRM systems, data dashboards, AI chatbots... but more importantly, training the team to listen carefully – understand deeply – handle delicately.",
      "On the journey ahead, I don't just want customers to “not complain,” but to proactively recommend the business to others.\nI don't just want the team to do things right, but to feel proud of every problem they solve.\nAnd I believe: future customer care will not only be in the call center but will appear at every touchpoint – every department – every interaction.",
      "I am here not just to tell a success story, but to write a new chapter for the customer experience with you – where service is a deep connection, not just a timely response.",
      "I am Nguyen Hung Thai – and this journey is still ongoing. Every message, every minute of listening, every small change in the system, is a step in a great journey: turning customers into sustainable companions.",
      "Thank you for listening."

Recognizing this, I led a strategic project to transform the entire Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system at MoMo, a project that was not only a technological upgrade but also a revolution in mindset and process.",
                "The biggest challenge was not choosing a technology platform, but how to seamlessly integrate data from countless touchpoints - from the app, website, call center, social media, to partners - into a single source of truth. We needed a system that not only stored information but also had the ability to analyze, forecast, and provide real-time action suggestions.",
                "The project was divided into 4 main phases: (1) Survey and Requirements Analysis, (2) Vendor and Platform Selection, (3) Implementation and Integration, (4) Training and Optimization. I worked directly with departments from Product, Marketing, to Operations to ensure the CRM system met everyone's needs while always placing the customer at the center.",
                "The result was a 360-degree view of the customer, allowing for personalized communication campaigns, proactive support, and a deeper understanding of user behavior. This not only increased customer satisfaction but also created new opportunities for business development based on data."

This project was about defining our 'North Star' and the specific metrics to guide us there.",
                "The primary challenge was to shift the team's focus from purely quantitative metrics (like number of calls handled) to quality and impact-oriented goals. We needed a system that balanced operational efficiency with the strategic goal of enhancing customer loyalty and lifetime value.",
                "We adopted the OKR (Objectives and Key Results) framework. Our Objectives were ambitious and qualitative, such as 'Create a frictionless support experience.' The Key Results were measurable outcomes, like 'Improve Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score from 85% to 90%' or 'Reduce customer effort score (CES) by 15%.' These were supported by traditional KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) like First Contact Resolution (FCR) and Average Handling Time (AHT) to monitor operational health.",
                "The implementation of this framework brought unprecedented clarity and purpose to the team. Everyone understood how their daily work contributed to the company's broader objectives. We saw a 10% increase in team engagement and successfully achieved our primary CSAT and CES targets within two quarters."

                "The main obstacle was internal silos. Each department (Marketing, Sales, Product, CS) had a piece of the puzzle, but no one had the complete picture. This resulted in a fragmented and sometimes contradictory experience for our customers.",
                "I spearheaded a series of cross-functional workshops involving stakeholders from all key departments. We used a combination of data analysis (from CRM and analytics tools) and qualitative feedback (customer interviews, surveys, support tickets) to build a comprehensive Customer Journey Map. This visual map detailed the customer's actions, thoughts, and feelings at each stage, from initial awareness to long-term loyalty.",
                "The CJM became an invaluable strategic tool. It exposed critical pain points we hadn't been aware of, such as a confusing onboarding process and a disconnect between marketing promises and product reality. The map provided a shared blueprint for improvement, leading to a 20% reduction in onboarding-related support tickets and a measurable uplift in user retention."

                "Our team struggled with a lack of visibility into ongoing improvement initiatives. Tasks would get stuck, priorities were unclear, and collaboration between team members was inefficient. We needed a system that promoted transparency, continuous flow, and rapid adaptation.",
                "We implemented a Kanban-based workflow management system. A large digital board was set up with columns: 'Backlog,' 'To Do,' 'In Progress,' and 'Done.' All departmental tasks, from updating a help article to investigating a recurring bug, were added as cards. This provided an immediate, shared view of all work. We also instituted brief daily 'stand-up' meetings to discuss progress and roadblocks.",
                "The results were transformative. The visual nature of the Kanban board eliminated confusion and improved accountability. The team's productivity increased by an estimated 25%, and the time to implement process improvements was cut in half. Most importantly, it fostered a culture of continuous improvement and proactive problem-solving."

This project's goal was to build a systematic bridge between raw customer feedback and the product development lifecycle, ensuring the voice of the customer directly influenced our roadmap.",
                "Valuable insights from customer conversations were often trapped in individual support tickets or agents' memories. There was no structured process to collect, analyze, and present this qualitative data to the Product and Engineering teams in an actionable way.",
                "We established a multi-faceted 'Voice of the Customer' (VoC) program. First, we implemented a robust tagging system in our CRM, allowing agents to categorize every interaction by feature request, bug report, or user confusion point. Second, I initiated a bi-weekly 'VoC Insights' meeting, where CS leadership presented a data-driven report to the Product team, highlighting trends, top issues, and direct customer quotes. A shared dashboard visualized this data in real-time.",
                "This feedback loop created a powerful alliance between CS and Product. The Product team gained a continuous stream of qualitative data to validate their hypotheses, and the CS team felt empowered, seeing their insights lead to tangible product improvements. This collaboration led to the prioritization of several highly-requested features, significantly boosting user satisfaction."

This foundational project was dedicated to documenting, refining, and standardizing our core processes to ensure every customer receives the same high level of service, regardless of the agent they interact with.",
                "Without clear, accessible guidelines, agent responses varied, leading to inconsistent customer experiences. Onboarding new hires was time-consuming and heavily reliant on shadowing senior members, and handling complex or sensitive issues lacked a uniform approach.",
                "I led a comprehensive initiative to create a centralized knowledge base of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). We started by mapping out every key customer interaction flow, from initial contact to issue resolution. For each step, we created clear, concise, and easy-to-follow SOPs, complete with scripts, checklists, and escalation paths. These were housed in a searchable internal wiki, becoming the team's single source of truth.",
                "The impact was immediate and significant. The time required to onboard a new agent to full productivity was reduced by 30%. Our First Contact Resolution (FCR) rate improved by 15% as agents were better equipped to handle issues independently. Most importantly, it established a baseline for quality, allowing us to coach and evaluate performance more effectively."

                "We architected and implemented a true omnichannel support solution. This involved migrating from separate tools to an integrated helpdesk platform that consolidated all customer interactions—whether from phone, email, social media, or live chat—into a single, chronological thread. Now, any agent could instantly see the customer's entire history, regardless of the channel used.",

Our CSAT scores saw a significant lift, with many customers positively commenting on the seamless experience. Internally, agent productivity increased as they no longer needed to switch between multiple systems to piece together a customer's history."

                "We took a strategic approach to automation. We started by analyzing our ticket data to identify the most frequent and time-consuming repetitive tasks. We then implemented a series of automations using our helpdesk's built-in workflows and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tools. This included auto-triaging and routing of new tickets, automated responses for common questions, and macros that allowed agents to perform multi-step processes with a single click.",

This allowed us to handle a higher volume of inquiries without increasing headcount and, more importantly, enabled our agents to dedicate more time to resolving complex customer issues, leading to more meaningful and satisfactory resolutions."

                "We developed a series of data-driven outbound campaigns. This included: personalized welcome calls to new high-value customers, proactive check-ins for users who encountered a known bug, satisfaction survey calls after a major interaction, and campaigns to re-engage dormant users with new feature information. We created detailed scripts and guidelines to ensure these interactions were helpful and value-adding, not intrusive.",

The feedback campaigns provided rich qualitative data for our product team. Overall, these campaigns shifted the perception of our CS department from a problem-solving center to a proactive partner in our customers' success."

                "I worked with our data analyst to connect our various data sources to a Business Intelligence (BI) tool. We designed a comprehensive dashboard with multiple views. The main view provided a high-level overview for leadership, tracking key metrics like CSAT, NPS, ticket volume, and resolution times over time. We also created team-specific views that allowed managers to monitor their team's performance, and even individual agent views to help them track their own progress against goals.",

There was no formal process for following up with customers who left negative feedback, which is a massive missed opportunity.",
                "We implemented an automated post-interaction survey system. Immediately after a ticket was resolved, customers received a simple one-question survey (CSAT or CES) via email or chat, with an optional field for comments. All responses were fed directly back into our CRM and linked to the specific ticket and agent. We created a workflow that automatically flagged all negative reviews and created a follow-up task for a team lead to personally contact the customer within 24 hours.",
                "This 'closed-loop' feedback system had a profound impact. Our survey response rate tripled. We were able to identify and address agent training needs more effectively.

Chúng tôi cần một hệ thống không chỉ lưu trữ thông tin mà còn có khả năng phân tích, dự báo và đưa ra các đề xuất hành động theo thời gian thực.",

Tôi đã làm việc trực tiếp với các phòng ban từ Sản phẩm, Marketing, đến Vận hành để đảm bảo hệ thống CRM đáp ứng nhu cầu của mọi người trong khi luôn đặt khách hàng làm trung tâm.",

Các Kết quả Chính là những kết quả có thể đo lường được, như 'Cải thiện điểm Hài lòng Khách hàng (CSAT) từ 85% lên 90%' hoặc 'Giảm điểm nỗ lực của khách hàng (CES) 15%.' Những điều này được hỗ trợ bởi các KPI (Chỉ số Hiệu suất Chính) truyền thống như Giải quyết trong lần liên hệ đầu tiên (FCR) và Thời gian xử lý trung bình (AHT) để theo dõi sức khỏe hoạt động.",

                "Khách hàng ngày nay mong đợi được tương tác với một doanh nghiệp theo cách của riêng họ, chuyển đổi giữa các kênh như email, trò chuyện và cuộc gọi điện thoại một cách dễ dàng. Dự án này là về việc phá bỏ các bức tường giữa các kênh hỗ trợ của chúng tôi để tạo ra một cuộc trò chuyện duy nhất, thống nhất với mỗi khách hàng.",
                "Vấn đề cốt lõi là một trải nghiệm rời rạc. Một khách hàng có thể bắt đầu một cuộc trò chuyện qua trò chuyện trực tiếp, theo dõi bằng một email, và sau đó gọi cho chúng tôi, phải lặp lại vấn đề của họ mỗi lần. Đây là một nguồn gây thất vọng lớn cho khách hàng và sự thiếu hiệu quả nội bộ.",
                "Chúng tôi đã kiến trúc và triển khai một giải pháp hỗ trợ omnichannel thực sự. Điều này liên quan đến việc chuyển từ các công cụ riêng biệt sang một nền tảng helpdesk tích hợp đã hợp nhất tất cả các tương tác của khách hàng—dù là từ điện thoại, email, mạng xã hội hay trò chuyện trực tiếp—vào một chuỗi thời gian duy nhất. Bây giờ, bất kỳ nhân viên nào cũng có thể ngay lập tức xem toàn bộ lịch sử của khách hàng, bất kể kênh được sử dụng.",
                "Việc chuyển sang omnichannel là một yếu tố thay đổi cuộc chơi. Nó đã giảm đáng kể nỗ lực cần thiết từ khách hàng của chúng tôi, một động lực chính của lòng trung thành. Điểm CSAT của chúng tôi đã có một sự gia tăng đáng kể, với nhiều khách hàng nhận xét tích cực về trải nghiệm liền mạch. Về mặt nội bộ, năng suất của nhân viên đã tăng lên vì họ không còn cần phải chuyển đổi giữa nhiều hệ thống để ghép lại lịch sử của khách hàng."

Dự án này tập trung vào việc xác định và tự động hóa các nhiệm vụ lặp đi lặp lại, giá trị thấp, giải phóng các nhân viên của chúng tôi để tập trung vào các tương tác phức tạp, đòi hỏi sự đồng cảm cao, nơi họ tạo ra nhiều giá trị nhất.",
                "Các nhân viên của chúng tôi đã dành một phần đáng kể thời gian trong ngày cho các nhiệm vụ thủ công: sao chép và dán dữ liệu giữa các hệ thống, phân loại phiếu và gửi các phản hồi theo công thức. Điều này không chỉ không hiệu quả mà còn dẫn đến kiệt sức và lấy đi thời gian khỏi sự tương tác thực sự với khách hàng.",
                "Chúng tôi đã có một cách tiếp cận chiến lược đối với tự động hóa. Chúng tôi bắt đầu bằng cách phân tích dữ liệu phiếu của mình để xác định các nhiệm vụ lặp đi lặp lại thường xuyên và tốn thời gian nhất. Sau đó, chúng tôi đã triển khai một loạt các tự động hóa bằng cách sử dụng các quy trình làm việc tích hợp của helpdesk và các công cụ Tự động hóa Quy trình bằng Robot (RPA). Điều này bao gồm việc tự động phân loại và định tuyến các phiếu mới, các phản hồi tự động cho các câu hỏi phổ biến và các macro cho phép các nhân viên thực hiện các quy trình nhiều bước chỉ bằng một cú nhấp chuột.",
                "Bằng cách tự động hóa hơn 30% các nhiệm vụ thủ công của chúng tôi, chúng tôi đã lấy lại được hàng nghìn giờ làm việc của nhân viên mỗi tháng. Điều này cho phép chúng tôi xử lý một khối lượng yêu cầu lớn hơn mà không cần tăng số lượng nhân viên và quan trọng hơn, cho phép các nhân viên của chúng tôi dành nhiều thời gian hơn để giải quyết các vấn đề phức tạp của khách hàng, dẫn đến những giải pháp có ý nghĩa và thỏa đáng hơn."

                "Giao tiếp của chúng tôi với khách hàng gần như hoàn toàn là phản ứng. Chúng tôi đợi họ liên hệ với chúng tôi khi có vấn đề.

                "Chúng tôi đã phát triển một loạt các chiến dịch outbound dựa trên dữ liệu. Điều này bao gồm: các cuộc gọi chào mừng được cá nhân hóa đến các khách hàng mới có giá trị cao, các cuộc kiểm tra chủ động cho những người dùng gặp phải một lỗi đã biết, các cuộc gọi khảo sát sự hài lòng sau một tương tác lớn, và các chiến dịch để tái tương tác với những người dùng không hoạt động bằng thông tin về tính năng mới. Chúng tôi đã tạo ra các kịch bản và hướng dẫn chi tiết để đảm bảo các tương tác này hữu ích và có giá trị gia tăng, không xâm phạm.",
                "Cách tiếp cận chủ động của chúng tôi đã rất thành công. Chiến dịch cuộc gọi chào mừng đã tăng tỷ lệ chấp nhận sản phẩm ban đầu lên 25% đối với những người dùng được nhắm mục tiêu. Các chiến dịch phản hồi đã cung cấp dữ liệu định tính phong phú cho đội sản phẩm của chúng tôi. Nhìn chung, các chiến dịch này đã thay đổi nhận thức về phòng CS của chúng tôi từ một trung tâm giải quyết vấn đề thành một đối tác chủ động trong sự thành công của khách hàng."

Điều này có nghĩa là chúng tôi thường chậm phản ứng với các xu hướng mới nổi, và đội ngũ thiếu tầm nhìn tức thì về hiệu suất của họ.",
                "Tôi đã làm việc với nhà phân tích dữ liệu của chúng tôi để kết nối các nguồn dữ liệu khác nhau của chúng tôi với một công cụ Kinh doanh Thông minh (BI).

Chế độ xem chính cung cấp một cái nhìn tổng quan cấp cao cho lãnh đạo, theo dõi các chỉ số chính như CSAT, NPS, khối lượng phiếu và thời gian giải quyết theo thời gian. Chúng tôi cũng đã tạo ra các chế độ xem dành riêng cho nhóm cho phép các nhà quản lý theo dõi hiệu suất của nhóm của họ, và thậm chí cả các chế độ xem của từng nhân viên để giúp họ theo dõi tiến độ của riêng mình so với các mục tiêu.",
                "Bảng điều khiển thời gian thực đã cách mạng hóa hoạt động của chúng tôi. Chúng tôi có thể phát hiện và giải quyết các xu hướng tiêu cực trong vài giờ thay vì vài tuần. Các yếu tố trò chơi hóa trên bảng điều khiển của nhóm đã thúc đẩy động lực và sự cạnh tranh lành mạnh. Quan trọng nhất, nó đã dân chủ hóa dữ liệu, nuôi dưỡng một văn hóa trách nhiệm và ra quyết định dựa trên dữ liệu trong toàn bộ phòng ban."

Không có quy trình chính thức để theo dõi những khách hàng để lại phản hồi tiêu cực, đó là một cơ hội bị bỏ lỡ lớn.",
                "Chúng tôi đã triển khai một hệ thống khảo sát sau tương tác tự động. Ngay sau khi một phiếu được giải quyết, khách hàng sẽ nhận được một khảo sát một câu hỏi đơn giản (CSAT hoặc CES) qua email hoặc trò chuyện, với một trường tùy chọn cho các nhận xét. Tất cả các phản hồi được đưa trực tiếp trở lại CRM của chúng tôi và được liên kết với phiếu và nhân viên cụ thể. Chúng tôi đã tạo ra một quy trình làm việc tự động gắn cờ tất cả các đánh giá tiêu cực và tạo một nhiệm vụ theo dõi cho một trưởng nhóm để liên hệ cá nhân với khách hàng trong vòng 24 giờ.",

Chúng tôi đã có thể xác định và giải quyết các nhu cầu đào tạo của nhân viên một cách hiệu quả hơn. Việc theo dõi phản hồi tiêu cực đã cho phép chúng tôi biến nhiều khách hàng không hài lòng thành những người ủng hộ trung thành, chứng tỏ rằng chúng tôi thực sự quan tâm đến trải nghiệm của họ."
